RULES:
- DO NOT remove or modify any existing feature, UI, routes, or logic

- All existing calls, video calls, encryption, contacts, queues, etc must remain intact

==============================

FREE USER RULES:

==============================
ACCESS GATING LOGIC
==============================

On every outbound call attempt:
IF user.plan == "FREE":
  - Check daily_outbound_calls < 5
  - Enforce max_call_duration = 15 minutes
  - Block scheduling, queues, paid links
  - If limits exceeded → show upgrade modal

IF user.plan == "PRO":
  - Allow unlimited outbound + duration
  - Enable paid call links
  - Enable scheduling

IF user.plan == "BUSINESS":
  - Enable all Pro features
  - Enable queues, public profile, dashboard

==============================
BILLING
==============================

- Stripe ONLY
- Monthly subscription billing
- No crypto, no wallets, no blockchain payments
- Trials allowed for Pro & Business
- Free tier requires NO payment method

==============================
UI UPDATES (ADD ONLY)
==============================

- Update /pricing page to reflect new tiers and limits
- Mark PRO as "Most Popular"
- Add subtle note on Free plan:
  "Designed for privacy & spam protection. Outbound limits apply."

- When Free limits are hit:
  Show upgrade modal → Pro $9 / Business $29

==============================
NON-NEGOTIABLE
==============================

- Free users must NEVER cause unbounded infrastructure cost
- Free tier must solve spam/privacy but push power users to upgrade
- All existing features must continue working exactly as before
