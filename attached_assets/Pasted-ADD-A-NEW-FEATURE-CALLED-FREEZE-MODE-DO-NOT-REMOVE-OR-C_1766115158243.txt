ADD A NEW FEATURE CALLED “FREEZE MODE”.
DO NOT REMOVE OR CHANGE ANY EXISTING FEATURE OR FUNCTIONALITY.
THIS FEATURE MUST BE ADDITIVE ONLY.

GOAL:
Allow users to intentionally silence carrier spam by making this app the only call/text notification channel.

========================
FEATURE: FREEZE MODE
========================

1) UI
- Add a toggle switch labeled “Freeze Mode”
- Description text:
  “Freeze all unwanted calls and texts. Only people you allow can reach you through this app.”

2) Behavior (App-Level)
When Freeze Mode is ON:
- Suppress all in-app notifications except:
  - Approved contacts
  - Paid / priority calls
- Require approval rules before a call can notify the user
- Default all new callers to “request access” (no ringing)

When Freeze Mode is OFF:
- App behaves normally

3) OS GUIDED SETUP (IMPORTANT)
On first enabling Freeze Mode:
- Show a guided setup modal explaining:
  - Turn on Do Not Disturb / Focus
  - Allow notifications from THIS app
  - Silence calls from unknown numbers
- Provide deep links to:
  - iOS Focus / DND settings
  - Android Focus / DND settings
(NOTE: Do NOT attempt to toggle OS settings programmatically.)

4) SERVER ENFORCEMENT
When Freeze Mode is ON:
- Reject calls from:
  - Unapproved contacts
  - External call links
  - Unknown users
- Calls must be explicitly allowed to notify the user

5) EMERGENCY BYPASS
- Allow user to mark trusted contacts as “Always Allowed”
- These contacts bypass Freeze Mode rules

6) ADMIN / PAID CONTROL
- Freeze Mode is available to all users
- Advanced rules (business hours, paid access, queue) remain PAID features

========================
COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
========================
- Do NOT claim OS-level blocking
- Do NOT intercept carrier calls or SMS
- Do NOT automate DND or Focus
- Feature must rely on user consent + guidance

========================
EXPECTED RESULT
========================
- User experiences a “frozen” phone
- Spam calls never interrupt them
- Only intentional calls notify
- App remains App Store compliant
