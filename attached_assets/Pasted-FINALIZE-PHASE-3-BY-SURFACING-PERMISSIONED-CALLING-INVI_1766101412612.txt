FINALIZE PHASE 3 BY SURFACING PERMISSIONED CALLING + INVITE PASSES + CALL REQUESTS IN THE MAIN UI — WITHOUT ADDING NEW FEATURES OR BREAKING EXISTING ONES.

DO NOT ADD NEW LOGIC. ONLY CONNECT EXISTING PHASE 3 FEATURES TO THE UI FLOW.

NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Do NOT remove or refactor Phase 1 or Phase 2 features.
- Do NOT change WebRTC or messaging internals.
- Only expose Phase 3 state visually and behaviorally.
- Keep mobile-first, WhatsApp-like UX.

TASKS TO COMPLETE

1) CONTACT DETAIL SCREEN — PERMISSION AWARE
When viewing a contact:
- Show their current permission status:
  - “Allowed”
  - “Blocked”
  - “Invite-only”
- If blocked → disable call buttons with label “Blocked”
- If invite-only → show “Send Call Request” instead of ringing
- Add quick actions:
  - Allow always
  - Block
  - Create one-time pass for this contact

2) INCOMING CALL UX — EXPLAIN WHY IT’S RINGING
On incoming calls:
- If allowed via contact → label: “Contact”
- If allowed via invite pass → label: “Invite Pass”
- If unknown but allowed → label: “Unknown caller”
- If policy converts to request:
  - Show “Call Request” screen instead of ringing
  - Buttons: Accept / Ignore / Block

3) CALL REQUESTS INBOX
- Add a lightweight “Requests” section:
  - Either inside Chats tab or as a badge on Calls
- Call requests should show:
  - Caller address
  - Reason (unknown / invite / expired attempt)
- Accepting request:
  - Rings back or opens call
  - Optionally auto-adds contact

4) INVITE PASSES — USER FEEDBACK
In Add tab → Invite Passes:
- Show active passes clearly:
  - One-time / expiring
  - Remaining uses
- When a pass is used:
  - Notify user: “Your invite pass was used”
  - Update remaining uses or mark burned

5) BLOCKLIST FEEDBACK
- If a blocked user attempts to call:
  - Do NOT ring
  - Log attempt silently
- In Blocklist:
  - Show “X blocked attempts prevented”

6) AI GUARDIAN (VISUAL ONLY)
Without changing logic:
- If AI Guardian is ON and flags a call:
  - Show banner: “Possible spam — AI Guardian”
  - One-tap “Block”

7) COPY / LABEL CLEANUP
- Replace technical wording with human language:
  - “Call Policy” → “Who can call me”
  - “Invite Pass” → “Call Invite”
  - “Unknown” → “Not in your contacts”

DELIVERABLE
- Phase 3 should now be visible, understandable, and explainable to a non-technical user.
- After implementation, list:
  - Where users see call permissions
  - Where call requests appear
  - How invite passes are surfaced

Proceed now.
