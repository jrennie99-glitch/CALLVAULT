Build me a production-ready MVP for crypto-address calling with AUDIO + VIDEO using WebRTC (internet-based, not PSTN).

CRITICAL RULES
- Do NOT remove or break any existing features once created.
- Do NOT use mock data. Calls must work live between two browser tabs/devices.
- Do NOT add “Replit agent” branding anywhere.
- Private key must stay in the browser (never sent to server).

DELIVERABLE
Create a Node.js Replit project with these files:
- package.json
- server.js
- /public/index.html
- /public/app.js

TECH
- Server: Node + Express + ws (WebSocket) for signaling only
- Client: Vanilla JS (no build tools) so it runs immediately on Replit
- Crypto: tweetnacl (Ed25519) + bs58 for base58 addresses
- WebRTC: RTCPeerConnection with STUN by default; TURN optional via env vars:
  TURN_URL, TURN_USER, TURN_PASS (if not set, still work with STUN)

FEATURES REQUIRED
1) Crypto Identity + Call Address
- On first page load generate Ed25519 keypair with tweetnacl.
- Store keys locally in browser (localStorage or IndexedDB).
- Display public key (base58).
- Generate and display a shareable call address derived from the public key:
  address format: call:<base58(pubkey)>:<base58(random8bytes)>
- Buttons: Copy Address, Generate New Address (rotates address).

2) Permissioned Incoming Calls
- Caller can ONLY ring callee using a valid call address.
- Caller must send a signed call-intent payload:
  intent = { from_pubkey, from_address, to_address, timestamp, nonce, media:{audio:true, video:true} }
- Signature = Ed25519 detached signature over a stable-stringified version of intent (keys sorted).
- Server verifies signature BEFORE delivering incoming call.
- Server enforces:
  - timestamp freshness (reject if older than 60 seconds)
  - replay protection: reject reused nonces for 2 minutes
  - basic rate limiting per from_address

3) Make + Receive Video Calls (WebRTC)
- Dial input to paste a destination call address.
- Call type selector: Video call / Audio-only.
- Outgoing flow: Call -> Ringing -> Accepted -> Connect.
- Incoming flow: Incoming call modal -> Accept / Reject.
- In-call UI:
  - local preview video (muted)
  - remote video
  - buttons: Mute, Camera On/Off, Switch Camera (mobile), Hang Up
- WebRTC signaling messages relayed via WebSocket:
  register, call:init, call:incoming, call:accept, call:reject, call:end,
  webrtc:offer, webrtc:answer, webrtc:ice

4) Server Behavior
- Maintain active WebSocket connections keyed by address string.
- Clients must “register” their current address.
- Prevent address spoofing: the socket must be registered to intent.from_address.
- Server never handles audio/video media—ONLY SDP + ICE.

5) Run
- Make Replit “Run” start the server.
- Serve the client from /public so it opens at the Replit web URL.

TEST INSTRUCTIONS (include in README comment at top of server.js)
- Open the app in two tabs/devices.
- Copy address from Tab A, paste into Tab B, call.
- Accept on Tab A, verify audio/video.

Now generate all files with complete working code.
