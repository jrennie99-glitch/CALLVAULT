REPLIT AGENT — ADD PLATFORM-SPECIFIC PRICING (ANDROID VS WEB/IOS) WITHOUT BREAKING EXISTING BILLING
App: Call Vault (CV) is already built. DO NOT remove or change any existing feature or functionality. Keep current Stripe billing working for web/PWA exactly as-is.

GOAL
Implement platform-specific pricing and checkout:
- Web/PWA uses existing Stripe plans/prices (unchanged).
- Android native app shows a different price for the same plan (e.g., Pro $6.99, Business $14.99).
- Entitlements are unified: Free/Pro/Business unlock the same features regardless of platform.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Add platform detection:
   - web, android, ios
   - If Capacitor is present and platform is android/ios, set platform accordingly.

2) Add pricing config in backend (DB table or config file):
   - plans: FREE, PRO, BUSINESS
   - price_web, price_android, price_ios
   - plus product identifiers for stores:
     - google_play_product_id_pro, google_play_product_id_business
     - apple_product_id_pro, apple_product_id_business (placeholder if not implementing iOS yet)

3) API endpoints (ADD ONLY):
   - GET /api/billing/plans?platform=<web|android|ios>
     returns plan names + features + correct price + purchase method
   - POST /api/billing/activate
     accepts provider receipt payload and activates entitlement (server-verified)
   Keep Stripe webhook logic unchanged.

4) UI:
   - Pricing page must show platform-correct prices based on detected platform:
     - Web => current Stripe checkout buttons
     - Android => “Subscribe in Google Play” button (stub if Play Billing not yet wired)
     - iOS => keep showing Stripe only in web/PWA; if native iOS later, use Apple IAP

5) Entitlements:
   - DO NOT create separate plan names.
   - Free/Pro/Business entitlements remain the single source of truth.
   - Platform only changes the price + purchase provider.

6) Safety:
   - Do not break existing subscribers.
   - Do not require users to re-subscribe.
   - Add admin tool to manually set plan for support.

DELIVERABLES
- List all files changed/added
- Where plan pricing is configured
- Confirm web Stripe remains unchanged
