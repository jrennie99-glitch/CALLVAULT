🚨 REPLIT BACKEND AUDIT — PRO & BUSINESS FEATURES (READ ONLY) 🚨

DO NOT modify, generate, refactor, or delete any code.
DO NOT add features.
DO NOT assume functionality.
This is an AUDIT ONLY task.

OBJECTIVE:
Audit the entire codebase (frontend + backend) to verify whether the Pro and Business features shown on the pricing page are actually implemented AND enforced by the backend.

You must inspect:
- All backend routes (/api, /server, /routes, /pages/api, /app/api)
- Middleware and authorization logic
- Database schemas / models / migrations
- Stripe billing logic and webhooks
- Feature flags, entitlements, or plan enforcement logic

AUDIT EACH FEATURE INDIVIDUALLY.

FEATURE LIST TO VERIFY:

FREE PLAN
- Unlimited incoming calls
- End-to-end encrypted calls
- Cryptographic identity
- Contact allowlist
- Freeze mode
- Outbound call limits (5/day)
- 15 minute max call duration
- 1 call at a time

PRO PLAN
- Unlimited outbound calls
- Unlimited call duration
- Unlimited daily calls
- Call scheduling
- Availability controls
- Paid call links
- Creator mode
- Higher call priority

BUSINESS PLAN
- Public profile page
- Call queue management
- Earnings dashboard
- Business mode
- Priority routing
- Custom branding
- Admin controls
- Priority support (flag only)
- Team / assistant support (future-ready)

FOR EACH FEATURE:
Determine ONE status only:
✅ Fully Implemented (backend + enforcement)
🟡 Partially Implemented (UI or backend only)
❌ Not Implemented (pricing text only)

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- If a feature exists only in UI or pricing, mark ❌
- If backend exists but no plan or role enforcement, mark 🟡
- If backend + plan/role enforcement exists, mark ✅
- Frontend-only checks do NOT count as implemented

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):

Return ONE table with these columns:

| Feature | Status | Evidence (file path + function/route) | Notes |

Evidence MUST reference:
- Exact file paths
- Function or route names
- Database tables or fields (if applicable)

AFTER THE TABLE, INCLUDE:
1) Summary count of Fully / Partial / Missing features
2) Missing backend pieces required for Business Admin functionality
3) Risk assessment if Pro or Business plans are sold today

STOP after completing the audit.
Do NOT suggest improvements.
Do NOT write code.
Do NOT optimize.

END OF PROMPT.
