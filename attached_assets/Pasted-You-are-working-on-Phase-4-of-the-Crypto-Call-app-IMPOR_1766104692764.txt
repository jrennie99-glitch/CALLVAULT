You are working on Phase 4 of the Crypto Call app.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT remove, rename, or break any existing feature, UI, or functionality.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated files.
- Only add or stabilize Phase 4 features.
- Everything must remain production-ready (no mock logic in final paths).

PHASE 4 OBJECTIVE:
Finalize Business / Creator Mode for monetized voice & video calls.

TASKS TO COMPLETE:

1) BUSINESS / CREATOR MODE (SETTINGS)
- Ensure Settings → Business Mode loads consistently.
- Creator Profile Settings must include:
  - Display name
  - Bio
  - Category / service type
  - Toggle ON/OFF (private users see no business UI)
- Add a visible “Pro / Business” badge when enabled.

2) PAID CALL CONFIGURATION
- Support BOTH pricing models:
  - Per-minute billing
  - Flat session price
- Pricing must apply to:
  - Voice calls
  - Video calls
- Validate pricing before call starts.
- Show price clearly BEFORE accepting a call.

3) AVAILABILITY & SCHEDULING
- Business Hours Scheduler:
  - Weekly schedule
  - Per-day availability windows
- Prevent paid calls outside business hours.
- If unavailable, show:
  “This creator is not accepting calls right now.”

4) STRIPE (TEST MODE – NO LIVE CHARGES)
- Stripe must be connected in TEST MODE only.
- Create Payment Intents when:
  - A paid call is accepted
- Do NOT auto-charge yet.
- Log call duration for later billing.
- Ensure Stripe errors do NOT crash the app.

5) CALL FLOW VALIDATION
- Voice calls and video calls must:
  - Start normally for free contacts
  - Require payment confirmation for paid calls
- No blank screens.
- No dead buttons.
- Calls tab must correctly reflect:
  - Free calls
  - Paid calls
  - Incoming requests

6) UI / UX FINAL CHECK
- Calls tab:
  - Paid call entry points visible only if Business Mode is ON
- Add tab:
  - Paid call setup accessible
- No duplicated buttons
- No empty states that block progress

7) DATA SAFETY
- Store:
  - Call metadata (type, duration, price)
  - Creator settings
- Do NOT store card data.
- Do NOT expose Stripe secrets to frontend.

FINAL STEP:
After completing all checks:
- Confirm Phase 4 is COMPLETE
- Summarize what is ready for Phase 5
- Do NOT start Phase 5 yet

Respond only after verification is complete.
