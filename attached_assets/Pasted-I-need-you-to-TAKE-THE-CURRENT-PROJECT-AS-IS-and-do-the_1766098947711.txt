I need you to TAKE THE CURRENT PROJECT AS-IS and do the following in order. Do NOT remove or change existing features or functionality. Only add what’s missing and fix bugs.

STEP 1 — RUN A FULL VALIDATION TEST (NO MOCKS)
1) Open the app in two browser tabs (Tab A and Tab B).
2) In Tab A: copy the current “Call ID”.
3) In Tab B: add Tab A as a contact by pasting the Call ID.
4) Start a VIDEO call from Tab B to Tab A.
5) Accept on Tab A.
6) Verify: local preview loads, remote video loads, and two-way audio works.
7) End the call; verify call history updates and shows the call.
8) Start an AUDIO-only call; accept; verify audio works; end call; verify history updates.

If ANY of the above fails, identify the exact failure, print the root cause, and implement the smallest code fix necessary. Do not refactor unrelated code.

STEP 2 — VERIFY APP LOCK (BIOMETRIC / PASSKEY)
1) Go to Settings and enable “App Lock (Face ID / Touch ID)”.
2) Reload the app; confirm lock screen blocks the UI.
3) Unlock successfully using WebAuthn platform authenticator.
4) Disable App Lock; reload; confirm no lock screen.
If any part fails, fix only the lock implementation and keep everything else unchanged.

STEP 3 — TURN SUPPORT CHECK (RELIABILITY)
1) Confirm the code reads TURN_URL, TURN_USER, TURN_PASS from environment variables.
2) If those are present, ensure RTCPeerConnection iceServers includes TURN plus STUN.
3) Show in Settings whether TURN is ACTIVE or STUN-ONLY.
Do not require TURN to run; app must still work with STUN only.

STEP 4 — PWA CHECK
1) Confirm manifest.json exists and is linked correctly.
2) Confirm service worker registers and caches only the app shell.
3) Confirm iOS Add-to-Home-Screen meta tags exist.
If anything is missing, add it with minimal changes.

STEP 5 — OUTPUT
When done, provide:
- A short checklist of what passed
- Any fixes you made (file + lines changed)
- Any remaining issues that require external TURN credentials or device permissions

IMPORTANT
- Do not add Replit branding.
- Do not remove or rename websocket message types.
- Do not change the crypto identity/signing scheme.
- Keep video calling working above all else.

Proceed now.
