I NEED YOU TO ADD A CLEAR VIDEO CALL OPTION IN THE UI (WHATSAPP-STYLE) WITHOUT BREAKING ANY EXISTING FEATURES OR CALL LOGIC.

CURRENT ISSUE
- The new mobile UI (Calls/Contacts/Add/Settings) is missing an obvious “Video Call” option.
- Video calling already exists in the project (WebRTC supports video), but the UI does not expose the button/flow.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
- Do NOT change the underlying WebRTC implementation or signaling message types unless absolutely necessary.
- Do NOT remove or rename any existing functions that currently place calls.
- Only add UI wiring so the user can choose VIDEO or AUDIO from Contacts and Add flows.
- Keep it mobile-first and WhatsApp-like.

REQUIRED UI CHANGES (DO THESE)
1) CONTACT DETAIL SCREEN
- When a user taps a contact, show a Contact Detail screen with:
  - Large “Video Call” button
  - Large “Audio Call” button
- Pressing Video Call must start a call with video enabled.
- Pressing Audio Call must start a call with video disabled (audio-only).

2) CONTACT LIST QUICK ACTIONS
- In the Contacts list rows, add two icons on the right (like WhatsApp):
  - video camera icon -> starts video call
  - phone icon -> starts audio call
- Keep rows thumb-friendly, do not clutter.

3) ADD TAB CALL TYPE SELECTOR
- In Add tab (where user pastes a Call ID), add a selector:
  - Video / Audio
- And a “Call Now” button that uses that selector.

4) CALL ENGINE WIRING (IMPORTANT)
- Reuse the existing call-start function(s). If there is a single function like startCall(toAddress) then extend it to accept callType:
  startCall(toAddress, { video: true/false })
- Ensure getUserMedia uses:
  - { audio: true, video: true } for video calls
  - { audio: true, video: false } for audio calls
- Ensure the call intent payload includes media flags (if your project already does this, keep format exactly; if missing, add media:{audio:true, video:true/false} without breaking server verification).

5) INCOMING CALL SCREEN
- If incoming call media.video is true -> show “Incoming Video Call”
- If false -> show “Incoming Audio Call”
- Accept must respect the type (video stays off for audio-only).

6) TESTS YOU MUST RUN
- Create a contact by pasting Call ID.
- Tap contact -> Video Call -> accept -> confirm remote video + audio works.
- Tap contact -> Audio Call -> accept -> confirm audio works and video stays off.
- Confirm old calling flow still works (if present).

DELIVERABLE
- Implement the missing screens/buttons and wiring.
- Do not change styling theme; keep it consistent with current UI.
- After changes, show me where the Video Call button is located (which screen) and confirm it works.

Proceed now.
