IMPORTANT RULES:
- DO NOT remove, rename, or break any existing features or UI.
- DO NOT refactor working code unless required for reliability.
- ONLY complete and harden Phase 4 features.
- App must remain production-ready at all times.

PHASE 4 – FINALIZATION & HARDENING TASKS:

1) Business / Creator Mode (FINALIZE)
- Ensure Business Mode toggle is persistent (saved per user).
- Creator Profile must include:
  • display name
  • bio
  • category
  • pricing model (per-call OR per-minute)
- Validate all inputs and show inline errors if incomplete.

2) Paid Calls Logic (UI + STATE)
- When Business Mode is ON:
  • Incoming calls must check pricing rules
  • If payment is required, show a “Payment Required” screen
- Ensure free calls still work for approved contacts.
- Make sure paid vs free logic is clearly separated.

3) Call Queue System
- If creator is unavailable:
  • Add caller to a visible queue
  • Show caller their queue position
  • Show creator a live queue list
- Queue must auto-clear when calls end.

4) Business Hours Enforcement
- Enforce weekly availability rules:
  • Block paid calls outside business hours
  • Show a clear “Unavailable” state
- Allow creator to override availability manually.

5) UI POLISH (NO REDESIGN)
- Ensure Calls, Contacts, Add, and Settings tabs are consistent.
- Empty states must always show a clear CTA button.
- Paid features should be labeled with subtle “Pro” badges.

6) Stability & Safety
- Add guards so failed payments never start a call.
- Prevent duplicate call sessions.
- Ensure refresh/reload does not break call state.

7) DO NOT ADD:
- No real Stripe charges yet (keep test mode only).
- No database migrations unless strictly necessary.
- No new tabs or navigation changes.

FINAL CHECK:
- App should behave like WhatsApp + Calendly + Paid Calling.
- Everything must work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- If anything breaks, auto-fix before stopping.

Confirm completion with:
- What was finalized
- What is now production-safe
- What is queued for Phase 5
