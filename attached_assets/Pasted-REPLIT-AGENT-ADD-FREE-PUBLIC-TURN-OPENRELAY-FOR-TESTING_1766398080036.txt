REPLIT AGENT — ADD FREE PUBLIC TURN (OPENRELAY) FOR TESTING ONLY (DO NOT BREAK ANYTHING)

App: Call Vault (CV) is already built. DO NOT remove or change any existing feature or functionality. This is an upgrade only.

GOAL
Make WebRTC calls work more reliably on cellular/mobile data by adding a free public TURN fallback for testing now.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Find where the app builds the WebRTC ICE servers (RTCPeerConnection config). This may be in:
   - client/src/* (WebRTC service)
   - lib/webrtc.ts / webrtc.js
   - callService.* / rtcService.*
   - any file that creates: new RTCPeerConnection({ iceServers: ... })

2) Keep any existing STUN servers and TURN logic exactly as-is.

3) Add these ICE servers to the existing iceServers list (do not remove anything):

   - STUN:
     stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
     stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302

   - TURN (Free public OpenRelay — TESTING ONLY):
     turn:openrelay.metered.ca:80 (udp)
     turn:openrelay.metered.ca:443 (udp/tls)
     turn:openrelay.metered.ca:443?transport=tcp

   Credentials:
     username: openrelayproject
     credential: openrelayproject

4) Add a feature flag so I can switch later:
   - Env var: TURN_MODE = "public" | "custom" | "off"
   - Default to "public" for now (if missing)
   - If TURN_MODE="custom", read env vars:
       TURN_URLS (comma separated)
       TURN_USERNAME
       TURN_CREDENTIAL
   - If TURN_MODE="off", keep STUN only.

5) IMPORTANT: Add clear comments in code:
   "OpenRelay public TURN is TESTING ONLY — not for production customers."

6) Add logging in dev mode so we can see if TURN is being used:
   - Log selected ICE candidate type and/or selected pair (relay vs srflx vs host)
   - Add a small debug indicator on the call screen: "ICE: host/srflx/relay"

7) Test Plan (must run and confirm):
   - Place a call device-to-device over Wi-Fi
   - Place a call device-to-device over cellular/mobile data (or hotspot)
   - Confirm connection succeeds and relay fallback works if needed
   - Confirm no existing features are broken

DELIVERABLES
- List all files changed
- Confirm existing STUN/TURN logic remains intact
- Confirm TURN_MODE env var works
