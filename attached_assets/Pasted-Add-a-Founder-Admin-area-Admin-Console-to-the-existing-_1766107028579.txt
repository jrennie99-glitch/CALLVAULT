Add a Founder/Admin area (Admin Console) to the existing Crypto Call app.

GOAL:
I (the founder) must have full access to manage users, trials, billing access, and system settings.

HARD RULES:
- Do NOT remove or change any existing feature or UI unless necessary
- Keep the current dark/crypto styling
- Add this as an additive module
- No mock security: protect admin routes properly

REQUIREMENTS:

1) Authentication + Roles
- Add RBAC with roles: "founder", "admin", "user"
- Only "founder" can create other admins
- Store role on the user record (DB)

2) Admin Console UI (new tab or Settings → Admin)
Create pages:
- Dashboard (key stats)
- Users (table with search/sort/filter)
- User Details (view + edit)
- Trials & Access
- System Settings (feature flags)

3) User Management Features
From Admin Console I can:
- Create a user (email/username or wallet-id based on how app works)
- Reset user access (disable/enable account)
- Assign role (user/admin) — founder-only can assign admin
- View user status: created date, last login, plan/trial status, calls count

4) Free Trial System
- Add trial fields on user:
  - trial_status: none | active | expired
  - trial_start_at, trial_end_at
  - trial_minutes_remaining (optional if we meter calls)
- Admin can grant:
  - X days free trial (e.g. 7/14/30)
  - OR X minutes free access for paid calls (e.g. 30 minutes)
- Trial should bypass paywall ONLY for the features you specify:
  - Paid calls access allowed when trial is active or minutes remain
  - After trial expiration, paid call requires Stripe payment again

5) Safe “Impersonate User” (Founder-only)
- Add “View as user” / impersonation for support testing
- Must be auditable: log who impersonated whom and when

6) Audit Logs (basic but real)
- Store admin actions in DB:
  - action_type, actor_user_id, target_user_id, timestamp, metadata
Examples: "GRANT_TRIAL", "DISABLE_USER", "ROLE_CHANGE", "IMPERSONATE_START"

7) API + Route Protection
- Protect admin endpoints server-side (not just client)
- Return 403 for non-admins
- Add middleware/guard that checks session + role

8) Seed Founder Access
- Ensure the initial account (my account) is "founder"
- Provide a safe way to set founder in env var for first boot:
  - FOUNDER_EMAIL or FOUNDER_USER_ID
- On startup, if no founder exists, promote the configured account

DELIVERABLES:
- Working Admin Console UI
- DB migrations/updates
- Secure server-side authorization
- A short checklist to test:
  - create user
  - grant trial
  - trial bypass paywall
  - trial expires → payment required
  - non-admin cannot access /admin
